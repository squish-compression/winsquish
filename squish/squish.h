/* ============================================================================
 * squish.h — public API of libsquish, a context-mixing compressor
 *
 * SQUISH compresses by prediction: ten statistical models (byte contexts of
 * order 0-6, a word model, an auto-detected record model, and a long-range
 * match model) each estimate the probability of the next bit; an online-
 * trained logistic mixer fuses them and an arithmetic coder emits the result.
 * The decompressor runs the identical models in lockstep.
 *
 * Characteristics
 *   ratio  : beats zip/bzip2/rar on 23/24 standard corpus files, xz -9e on 19/24
 *   speed  : ~0.5-0.7 MB/s, symmetric (compression == decompression cost)
 *   memory : ~150 MB of model state per active (de)compression, plus buffers
 *   limits : inputs up to 4 GiB - 16 bytes
 *
 * Thread safety
 *   The library keeps NO global mutable state. Every call allocates its own
 *   model state, so concurrent calls from different threads are safe as long
 *   as they do not share src/dst buffers.
 *
 * Parallelism
 *   The squish_*_mt functions split the input into independent chunks and
 *   run one model per chunk across worker threads ("SQ01" multi-block
 *   streams): near-linear speedup at a small ratio cost (each chunk's model
 *   starts cold). Output depends only on the chunk size, never on the
 *   thread count. Plain squish_decompress* reads both formats. Budget
 *   ~150 MB of model memory per thread.
 *
 * Integrity
 *   Every stream carries a 32-bit checksum (FNV-1a 64, folded) of the
 *   original data; squish_decompress verifies it and fails on mismatch.
 *
 * Minimal example
 *   size_t   cn;  void *c;
 *   squish_compress_alloc(data, n, &c, &cn);          // compress
 *   size_t   dn;  void *d;
 *   squish_decompress_alloc(c, cn, &d, &dn);          // decompress + verify
 *   squish_free(c); squish_free(d);
